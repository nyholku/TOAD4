Introduction

This document describes the communication protocol for TOAD4 firmware. 

TOAD4 is a 4-axis motor controller with USB interface based on PIC18F4550 and
it is aimed for CNC applications. It supports commands queues for un-interrupted
movements and position capture to implement probing. It also supports digital I/O
and analog (PWM) output. 

TOAD4 is intended to be used with EazyCNC software in which case the information
in this document is not needed, this document is intended for the developers
wishing to use the TOAD4 for something else or needing to understand the
communication protocol in detail.


Chapter 1 - Virtual Serial Port

To the operating system TOAD4 appears as a USB CDC ACM device i.e. virtual serial port. 
In Windows it looks like a COM port, Mac OS X it appears as a '/dev/tty.usbmodem*' and
in Linux look for '/dev/tty.ACM*'. (Actually it maybe better to open the device using
the name 'cu.*' instead of 'tty.*').

As this is a virtual serial device the baud rate etc is immaterial and no attempt should 
be made to set it.


Chapter 2 - Protocol Over View

The protocol is binary (as opposed to text) for efficiency and space considerations and
thus it is futile to try to communicate with TOAD4 using a terminal, besides timing
is not suitable for keyboard entry.

The protocol is based on messages that contain one or more commands.

The communication is a simple master/slave protocol where master (PC) sends
a message and the slave (TOAD4) responds. TOOD4 will never send anything unless
asked for. 

TOAD4 will always wait for a complete message before attempting to interpret it.

If a complete message is not received within 21.7 msec TOAD4 for disregard all
bytes received so far and will start to look for a byte with the MSB set.

If TOOAD4 does not respond or responds badly the master needs to
keep a pause longer than XX msec and then start with a new complete message.

This import to synchronize both ends of the communication, both initially
or in case of an error (note that since this is a virtual serial port on top
of USB protocol communication errors are very, very rare).

Chapter 3 - Message Format

A message is a series of bytes that is preceded with a byte that has the MSB bit set
and lower seven LSB bits contain the line length and followed by a check sum. The
maximum length of a message all bytes included is 32 bytes. 

The length does not include the length byte itself i.e. it is the number of bytes
TOAD4 will read after seeing the first byte of the message before attempting to
interpret the message.

The check sum is a simple 8 bit unsigned sum of the pay load of the message i.e. the
sum of all bytes excluding the first (the length) and last (the checksum) bytes with
a seed value of hex 0x55 for the sum.

Each command start with a byte that identifies the command and motor it refers to,
followed by zero or more parameters related to the particular command. The three
LSB bits of the byte define the motor and the seven MSB bits define the command.


For each message TOAD4 responds with a corresponding return message that
has the same overall format i.e. it starts with the 0x80 + length byte,
followed by the payload and ends with a checksum. 

The return message payload contains a response for each command that was
sent to the TOAD4 in the same order as the commands were sent. The response
is a byte error code followed by zero or more return values depending on 
the command.


Chapter 4 - Motion control 

4.1 - Position Counter

TOAD4 maintains a position counter for each motor which is simply 
a signed 32 bit counter that is incremented or decremented every time the 
firmware generates a step pulse for a motor.  

In 'forward' direction the position counter is incremented for each
step performed and the direction control output is in forward state. 

In 'reverse' direction the counter is decremented and the direction output is 
in reverse state. 

The hardware state (ON/OFF, 1/0) for forward and reverse states of the 
direction output are configurable, see CMD_SET_MODE. 

4.2 - Step rate 

For commands that specify the step rate i.e. velocity of a stepper it is
specified with a 16 bit unsigned integer value in the range 0..65535. 
To convert this value to steps / second use:

steps_per_second = (velocity_value / 65536) * 11718.75 

The stepping signal is generated by continuously adding (in a 11718.75
kHz  timer interrupt routine) the 16 bit unsigned  speed value to 
a 16 bit unsigned counter and when ever this counter overflows a step 
is generated.

This gives the slowest possible step rate of about one step every 5th 
second and highest step rate of little over 11 kHz.
             
 Note that there is jitter in the generated step signal which is 
 proportional  to the step rate. For a speed  value of S the jitter 
 max is in the ball park of S/65536 * 100% percentage. Depending on 
 the stepper motor and mechanics jitter is the limiting factor
 for highspeed operation.
 

4.4 Command execution and queuing

Most commands are executed as soon as they are interpreted but movement commands
are queued and synchronized. This means that up to 16 movement commands can be
sent to the TOAD4 and it will execute those commands one after the other as
the movements are completed. Synchronizing ensures that movement commands are 
executed before previous move commands for all motors have completed.  

4.5 - Movement/queue synchronization

When a motor is configured (with CMD_SET_MODE command) a bit mask is given
that specifies which queues/motors this motor should be synchronized with.
Specify a 1 in the mask for each motor you need to synchronize the motor
with, bit 0 (LSB) corresponds to motor 0, bit 1 to motor 2 and so on.

Chapter 5 - Commands

5.1 - Command id byte

As mentioned above each command starts with a byte that identifies the 
command and the motor it refers to.

The least significant 3 bits specify the motor so up to 8 motors
can be controlled (but TOAD4 only supports 4) and the 5 most
significant bits identify the command so there can be a maximum of 
32 commands, of which 18 are currently implemented and are described here.


5.1 - Return values

All commands return a one byte error code which is one of the following:

ARG_OK                  0
ARG_MISSING             1
ARG_QUEUE_FULL          2
ARG_RESP_TOO_LONG       3
ARG_BAD_COMMAND        11
ARG_LINE_TOO_LONG      12

The normal return code ARG_OK (0) indicates that the command execution
was successful.

ARG_MISSING indicates that the message TOAD4 received was too short and
did not contain enough data/parameters for the commands it contains.

ARG_QUEUE_FULL indicates that a move command (CMD_MOVE_DISTANCE) was
attempted but the queue for that motor was full.

ARG_RESP_TOO_LONG indicates that the response requested/required by the 
commands exceeded 48 bytes, ie too many commands were sent to TOAD4
in a single message.

ARG_BAD_COMMAND indicates that the command identified by the first
byte of a command was not one of those supported by TOAD4 and specified
here.

ARG_LINE_TOO_LONG indicates that the message was longer than 32 bytes
so the message is disregarded.

Chapter 6 - Command details




The following description of the commands are formatted like this:

Command:    Command name
Id:         The command number (shift left three times and stick to first byte with
            relevant motor number in the three least significant bits.
Parameters: Short description of the parameters the command takes and their types:
Returns:    Short description of the return values and their types 

Paramter type coding:
            (B)  Byte (Unsigne 8 bits)
            (DB) Double Byte (16 bits, MSB first)
            (QB) Quad byte (32 bits, MSB first)
            (S)	 Signed
            (U)  Unsigned


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Command:     CMD_MOVE_DISTANCE 
ID:          1
Parameters:  Distance (DB,S)
             Speed  (DB,U)
Returns:     Error code (B,U)

Description: This command queues one move command into the specified motors
             command queue. The movement will be executed once all the 
             commands put into the queue prior to this have been completed
             in all the synchronized queues.
             
             If queue processing has not been enabled with CMD_ENABLE_QUEUE
             then the commands are queued but not executed until the queue
             is enabled, this allows 'pre-loading' of the queue without
             actually causing any moves.
             
             The Distance parameter gives the signed distance to move in steps.
             Negative values indicate 'reverse' and  positive 'forward' direction.
                          
             The Speed parameter gives the unsigned step rate in units of
             11718.75 / 65536 steps/second.

Description: This command sets up and starts jogging. During joggin the motor
             runs as long as CMD_CTRL_JOG commands are sent to the TOAD4.
             
             The Lo-velocity parameter specifies the starting and lowest velocity
             used during jogging.
             
             The Hi-velocity parameter specifies the top velocity used during 
             jogging.
             
             The acceleration parameter specifies the acceleration used to
             ramp from Lo velocity to Hi velocity, in units of  11718.75 / 65536 
             steps/second squared
             
             The Min crawl distance specifies the minimum number of steps the
             motor will jog regardless how soon it is stopped.
             
             The crawl parameter specifies how long a distance the motor
             will run at the Lo velocity before it will accelerate to the
             Hi velocity. 
             
             The timeout specifies the number of steps the motor will take
             before it stops if it does not receive a new CMD_CTRL_JOG command.
             If no new CMD_CTRL_JOG command is received the motor will start
             to decelerate to the Lo-speed and once it reaches that it will stop.
             
             

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Command:     CMD_RESET_QUEUE
ID:          8
Parameters:  -
Returns:     Error code (B,U)
            
Description: This command empties the command queue and places it the disabled
             in which commands can be received and queued but are not executed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Command:     CMD_ENABLE_QUEUE 
ID:          9
Parameters:  -
Returns:     Error code (B,U)
            
Description: This command enables queued command execution. In this state
             commands from the queue are executed as long and as soon as 
             there are commands in the queue.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Command:     CMD_QUEUE_STATE
ID:          10
Parameters:  -
Returns:     Error code (B,U)
             State (B,U)
             Size (B,U)
             Capacitu (B,U)
            
Description: This command returns the queue state for the given motor.

             The State returned gives the internal state machine state
             for the given motor, used for debugging.
             
             The Size returned is the number of commands currently in the queue.
             
             The Capacity returned is the maximum number of commands the queue
             can hold, so the number of free places in the queue is 
             Capacity - Size
             
             
             

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Command:     CMD_MOTOR_STATE
ID:          11
Parameters:  -
Returns:     Error code (B,U)
             State (B,U)
            
Description: This command  the internal state machine state for the given motor,
             used for debugging.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Command:     CMD_SET_MODE
ID:          12
Parameters:  Sync flags (B,U)
             Enable (B,U)
             Full torque (B,U)
             Home polartiy (B,U)
             Direction polarity (B,U)
             
Returns:     Error code (B,U)
            
Description: This command sets the motor drive current and configures the polarity 
             of the Home and Direction signals. It also specifies which motors 
             this motor is synchronized with.
             
             The Sync flags parameter is a bit mask with a bit set to one for
             each motor that is synchronized together. LSB (bit 0) represents
             motor 0 and so forth.
             
             The Enable parameter controls weather the Enable signal is turned
             on or not and thus weather the motor driver circuitry for the motor is 
             is on or not. If not enabled the will not run and the driver is
             in high impedance state letting the motor move freely with external
             forces.
             
             The Full torque parameter controls weather the Torque signal for the
             given motor is turned on or not. If the signal is turned on then the
             driver circuitry will supply high current to the motor, otherwise
             it will supply low current. Actual current values depend on the
             the jumpers settings and current measurement resistor values on the
             TOAD4 board.
             
             The Home polarity parameter specifies weather the Home/Ref signal is
             1 or 0 when the motor/axis is at low end of the axis travel, low meaning
             that coordinates at the end of the travel are smaller that at
             the high end.
             
             The Direction polarity parameter specifies weather the direction
             signal is 1 or 0 when the motor is driven/stepped to the forward
             direction.
             
             
             
             

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Command:     CMD_SEEK_HOME
ID:          13
Parameters:  Lo-velocity (DB,U)
             Hi-velocity (DB,U)
             Acceleration (DB,U)
             Timeout (QB,U)
Returns:     Error code (B,U)
            
Description: This command causes the motor seek the Home/Ref switch.

             If the motor is not 'at home' when this command is given
             the motor will run in reverse direction at the speed given 
             by the Hi-velocity parameter.
             
             Once the Home/Ref signal becomes active the motor will back out
             from that position running the motor forward at the speed given 
             by the Lo-velocity parameter.
             
             If above process cannot be completed within the number of 
             steps given by the Timout parameter the process is aborted.
             

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Command:     CMD_CTRL_JOG
ID:          14
Parameters:  Jog flag (DB,U)
Returns:     Error code (B,U)
            
Description: This parameter re-sets the CMD_JOG_FORWARD/Timeout parameter. By
             sending this command repeatedly with a small Jog flag value the
             jogging is kept running as long as the commands are sent. This
             implements a sort of dead man switch i.e. the motor will stop
             if the communication from the host stops.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Command:     CMD_SET_POS
ID:          15
Parameters:  Position (QB,U)
Returns:     Error code (B,U)
            
Description: This command re-sets the 32 bit signed position counter for the 
             given motor to  the value given by the Position parameter and 
             all further stepping will then increment or decrement from that
             value and be reported by the CMD_GET_POS command.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Command:     CMD_GET_POS
ID:          16
Parameters:  -
Returns:     Error code (B,U)
             Position (QB,U)

Command:     CMD_GET_VERSION
ID:          17
Parameters:  -
Returns:     Error code (B,U)
             Version string 16 x (UB) (terminated string)
            
Description: This commands returns the firmware version and hardware build  in the
             form of a null terminated C-style string. Regardless of the length
             of the string 16 bytes are always returned. The version number has
             the following format.
             
             major.minor.fix-build
             
             Major value gets incremented when new features are added or removed from
             the firmware which make it incompatible with previous versions.
             
             Minor value gets incremented when new features are added, in general the
             firmware remains compatible with the older versions.
             
             Fix gets incremented if a bug is fixed and the firmware remains fully
             compatible with the previous versions
             
             Build indicates which version of hardware the firmware has been built for.
             Value of 4 indicates the current (as of this writing) TOAD4 hardware.
             

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Command:     CMD_ARM_PROBE
ID:          18
Parameters:  Stop speed (DB,U)
             Deceleration (DB,U)
Returns:     Error code (B,U)
            
Description: This commands arms the position capture or probe feature. When armed
             the values of all stepper motor position counters are copied to 
             a capture memory when the probe signal activates and the motors
             are brought to stand still.
             
             The Deceleration parameters specifies the deceleration used to
             bring the motors to a stop.
             
             The Stop speed parameter specifies the low speed at which or 
             below the motor is completely stopped when it is being decelerated.

             for the given axis. If the probe is still armed i.e. it has not
             triggered yet and thus no probing has taken place this command
             return the value of 0x80000000 or -2147483648.

             is used to trigger the probe function.
             
             The input parameter specifies the input to be used, current firmware
             ignores this parameter and always uses the PROBE signal.
             
             The value parameter specifies the value (1 or 0) that will trigger
             the probe position capture.

Rather trying to verbally describe this further I think it is best to refer
to the  Java code for the nitty-gritty details of communicating with TOAD4,
See the classes in package 'eazycnc.toad4'.
